## Elite-Dangerous-DiscordRP
A program that gives rich presence functionality to Elite: Dangerous. Written during the Horizons update for the game. Still in development for further functionality.

## Usage

To use this program, download the zip file from the releases tab on the right.

Then find RichPresence.exe inside the unzipped folder and double click to launch

That's it! It will open a CMD looking window and will keep printing information. You can leave it running in the background and it won't update rich presence until Elite has been launched. Please do make sure that it's pointing to the right log file (you can restart the program once you've spawned into the game to ensure this).
