## Elite-Dangerous-DiscordRP
A program that gives rich presence functionality to Elite: Dangerous. Written during the Horizons update for the game. Still in development for further functionality.

## Usage

To use this program, first create a clone of the repository to your local machine.

Then find RichPresence.py inside the unzipped folder and open it using an editor (notepad is fine). You're looking for the list_of_files variable which will have a piece of placeholder text (*your username here*)

Change that to your personal username(For example C:/Users/SamKuls/Saved Games/Frontier Developments/Elite... where "SamKuls" is your username) and save the file

Hit F5 in the Idle editor or close down the editor and double click on the .py file and it should open up a cmd-looking interface.

Congratulations! That's it. You should now be all set up to show off to your progress to your friends.
